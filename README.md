# Diffusion Text-to-Image Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a text-to-image diffusion model implementation, focused on generating images from user-provided prompts. The core of the project is a Jupyter notebook (`6_diffusion_textprompt.ipynb`) that enables experimentation with diffusion-based generative models for high-quality image synthesis. The project features an example based on the University of California, Irvine (UCI) mascot, the Anteater, as seen in the included media file `zot.jpg`.

## Features

- Text-to-image synthesis using modern diffusion models.
- Jupyter notebook for end-to-end experimentation.
- Demonstration visuals utilizing the UCI Anteater mascot.
- Results/analysis provided in `results.pdf`[attached_file:c335d613-f26c-46fc-96a0-64b774828a72].

## Installation

1. Clone this repository and ensure you have the following files:
   - `6_diffusion_textprompt.ipynb`
   - `zot.jpg`
   - `results.pdf`
   - `README.md`

2. Set up your Python environment (recommended: Python 3.8+).

3. Install required dependencies, typically found in the notebook. Common requirements include:
    - `torch`
    - `transformers`
    - `diffusers`
    - `PIL`

   You can install dependencies using pip:

   
4. (Optional) Set up Jupyter if not already installed:
 ```
 pip install notebook
 ```

## Usage

- Open the notebook `6_diffusion_textprompt.ipynb` in Jupyter.
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to input custom text prompts and generate images.
- Example prompt: "Create an image of the UCI Anteater mascot."
- Results will be displayed in the output cells, and additional analysis or metrics can be found in `results.pdf`[attached_file:c335d613-f26c-46fc-96a0-64b774828a72].

## Example Output

The project features the UCI Anteater as a sample subject.
